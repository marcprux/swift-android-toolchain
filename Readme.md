## My Town

This Open source project won't be updated until Kremlin will stop war in Ukraine and repair damages made in towns: Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel. If this won't happen during next 6 months (until 1 September 2022), then this project will be removed from public space.

## Requirements

- macOS 12
- Xcode 13 or 14
- Android Studio 2020.3.1
- Android NDK (See version number in file `NDK_VERSION` in the root of this repository)
- Node 14.17.3 (node -v). Newer versions may also work, but not tested.
- CMake 3.21.2 (cmake --version)
- Ninja 1.10.2 (ninja --version)
- autoconf 2.71 (autoconf --version)
- aclocal 1.16.4 (aclocal --version)
- glibtool 2.4.6 (glibtool --version)
- pkg-config 0.29.2 (pkg-config --version)

## Important

- Toolchain build may fail if macOS headers installed under `/usr/include`. This usually happens if you previously installed package `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg`. See details in [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_release_notes#3035624) notes. See following [SuperUser question](https://superuser.com/questions/36567/how-do-i-uninstall-any-apple-pkg-package-file) about how to uninstall package.
- Toolchain build may fail if the command line tools are present in `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`. Remove them if you are not using them. See: [macos - How do I uninstall the command line tools for Xcode? - Ask Different](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/308943/how-do-i-uninstall-the-command-line-tools-for-xcode)

Keep tools like `CMake` and `ninja` up to date.

## Using pre-built toolchain

Build of complete toolchain takes ~1.5h. Instead of building it you can just download and use already pre-built package from [Releases](https://github.com/vgorloff/swift-everywhere-toolchain/releases) page.

## Setup and Build

1. Install CMake, Ninja, Autotools and git-lfs. Check that all requirements are installed.

   ```bash
   brew install cmake ninja autoconf automake libtool pkg-config git-lfs
   which cmake
   which ninja
   which autoconf
   which aclocal
   which glibtool
   which pkg-config
   which git-lfs
   ```

2. Make sure that `Xcode Build Tools` properly configured.

   ```bash
   xcode-select --print-path
   ```

3. Clone this repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vgorloff/swift-everywhere-toolchain.git
   cd swift-everywhere-toolchain
   ```

4. Create a symbolic link to NDK installation directory.

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/ndk
   sudo ln -vsi ~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/$VERSION /usr/local/ndk/$VERSION
   ```

   The placeholder `$VERSION` needs to be replaced with a version mentioned in file `NDK_VERSION` at the root of cloned repository.

5. Start a build.

   ```bash
   node main.js
   ```

6. Once the build completed, toolchain will be saved to folder `ToolChain/swift-android-toolchain` and compressed into archive `ToolChain/swift-android-toolchain.tar.gz`.

## Usage

Please refer file [Assets/Readme.md](Assets/Readme.md) to see how to compile Swift files or build Swift packages using Toolchain.

## Sample Projects

Sample projects can be found in a separate [swift-everywhere-samples](https://github.com/vgorloff/swift-everywhere-samples) repository. Please look into `Readme.md` in that repository to get information about how to configure and build sample projects.
